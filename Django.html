    <h3>Raising a Rescue</h3>
         <p>After Buster left us last winter, we were just a couple of broken hearts wandering around.

Of course as time marches past you, you feel better and finally do stop crying. But even after the spring and summer have come and gone and you are happy and laughing again, there is still a place just big enough for a small dog to fit.

Enter Django. Or Bo Jangles as my dad calls him, or DejaVu as my mom calls him; or Niko, Stich or Rothko as he was known in his foster homes and at the shelter where he was picked up as a stray.

We were going to name him Vincent, as in van Gogh because he is missing a bit of ear....


But in the end we decided on Django, and then it was confirmed when we saw his little feet. He has 'high toes' and his front feet look just like Django Reinhardt's right hand....




And so it goes, four days have passed and I can't recall the last time we laughed from morning until night, every day. And I have never seen such a happy dog as this, when he jumps up on the bed at night where he goes smiling to sleep. Life is very, very good.

A HUGE shout out to New Rattitude! Without them and their team of amazing, selfless volunteers we  would not have this little spud. Adopt, please don't shop.

        A: We found an interesting article about the 'Rule of threes'. Getting comfy comes in stages: 3 days, 3weeks and 3 months. We also added 3'years' because it seems like it may take a longer period of time for total trust to come.

      <div class="panel-body">
        A: Prior to bringing a 'rescue' pet home, you should be aware that you can never know all of his behaviors, because you can never know his/her full history. Often challenging behaviors may not csurface for weeks after you bring your rescue home. It is in the best interest of you and your pet to be as informed as possible, and when in doubt, contact a pet behavior specialist or trainer in your area.

        A: I was unsure of this as well until I read a great article by a trainer who said that it is actually better to give them a new name, as they may have bad memories associated with their old one. We were fortunate in that although it was a month before we got Django hom, the foster home had been calling Rothko, so it wasn't too much of a change and he seemed to come when called no problem! treats help!

    </div>
    <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
        A: This can be a misconception, and our foster parents said to pretend your rescue is a new puppy for at least two weeks. That means try to take them out every two hours. Even though they may indeed be house trained, they are not house trained for your house! We only had once accident when Django tried to mark, but he has never done it again now that he is on a regular schedule. For dogs you can use a 'belly band' for the first little bit to prevent a big cleanup.

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
        A: The cost associated with rescuing a pet can be on par with adopting a pet from your local SPCA. In our case the actual cost was less, but we also made a donation to the Rescue group because of the amazing job they did, and continue to do for many other dogs. An important thing to remember is, that a rescue may need special medical care and/or training, and so may cost you more in the long run. Be ready, you can't give the dog back if you decide you can't afford it.

         <h3>Django's Story</h3>
    <p> Django's story began in two different places at two different times. Sadly we only know one side of the story for sure, that's our side. Our story began on Dec 22nd 2013, when we had to put our Rat Terrier, 'Buster' down, at the age of 19 years and 11 months. He had developed cancer and was at his life's end. It was the most difficult thing we have ever had to do, saying goodbye to that dog. We have to hand it to our vet, Dr Sandra Madden of My Vancouver Vet, who runs a mobile Veterinarian service. Two years earlier I had contacted her to see if she would euthenize our pets at home and she has been our Vet ever since. I think losing Buster was also very tough on her, he had been her longest living patient in her 20 years as a vet.</p>

        <p> Although after that day we swore we could never have another dog, there was always something in the back of our minds, that maybe one day , yes, maybe one day far into the future we could - maybe. But then we let grief overtake us and we were just a couple of broken hearts wandering around for 8 months, noticing a very bog hole in our lives. We began checking out Rat Terrier videos and once in a while looking at the SPCA search pages to see what type of dogs were available. </p> <p> At one point we did see one dog named 'Lucky', a Basset Hound cross. Although we didnt know if he was our dog, we were unsure about another breed. One day though we looked at the SPCA website and Lucky had found a new home. It was then that we started thinking that yes, maybe we could get another dog. It started to feel 'ok', like Buster would have approved, and we then began the search for 'Buster's little brother' as we called him.</p><p>In the meantime I sewed up a load of fleece blankets and beanbags for our local pet Hospice and donated them in Buster's name. That felt good, and helped along our grief process; we didn't want to still be fresh in grief with a new pet. It was arund that time that we began to seriously look at Rat Terrers. In our minds they are th perfect breed for us, but we didn't want to buy from a breeder with so many dogs out in the world that needed homes. So we searched for a rescue and found one in Canada. The problem was though, that they did not want to send a dog across Canada, so they pointed us to Washington State and New Rattitude. </p>
